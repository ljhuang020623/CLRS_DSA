Chapter 10: Elementary Data Structures

This chapter examines the representation of dynamic sets by simple data structures that use pointers.
Although many complex data structures can be built using pointers, this chapter focuses on the rudimentary ones:
arrays, matrices, stacks, queues, linked lists, and rooted trees.

10.1 Simple array-based data structures: arrays, matrices, stacks, queues

10.1.1 Arrays
-------------
An array is stored as a contiguous block of memory. In most programming languages, if the first element of an array
is at a starting memory address (say, A) and each element occupies a fixed number of bytes (say, b), then the nth
element (using 0-indexing) resides at the memory address computed as:

    Address = A + (n * b)

For example:
- The 0th element occupies addresses A to A + b - 1.
- The 1st element occupies addresses A + b to A + 2*b - 1.

This fixed-size layout allows constant-time access to any element, assuming that all memory locations are equally
accessible (as in the RAM model). Most programming languages require each element of an array to be of the same size.
If elements vary in size, the array typically stores pointers to objects rather than the objects themselves.

10.1.2 Matrices
--------------
A matrix (or two-dimensional array) is generally represented using one or more one-dimensional arrays. The two most 
common methods are row-major and column-major order. In row-major order, an mÃ—n matrix is stored row by row, while 
in column-major order, it is stored column by column. Alternative strategies involve storing each row (or column) in its 
own array and maintaining a separate array of pointers to these rows (or columns). Single-array representations are 
usually more efficient, while multiple-array approaches offer flexibility, such as supporting ragged arrays.

(m x n matrix)
If the row, columns and the single array all are indexed starting at s, then M[i,j] the element in row i and column j 

row major order index: s + (n(i - s)) + (j - s)
column major order index: s + (m(j - s)) + (i - s)

10.1.3 Stacks 
-------------------------
A stack is a dynamic data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
This means the most recently inserted element is the first one to be removed.

Key Characteristics:
--------------------
- LIFO Behavior:
  The last element pushed onto the stack is the first element popped off.

- Main Operations:
  - PUSH: Inserts an element onto the stack.
    * In an array-based implementation, this involves incrementing a pointer (or index) and placing the new element at that position.
  - POP: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
    * This operation decrements the pointer, effectively "forgetting" the removed element.
  - STACK-EMPTY: A check to determine if the stack contains any elements.
    * When the pointer (e.g., 'top') indicates an empty state (such as a value of -1), the stack is empty.

- Error Conditions:
  - Underflow: Occurs when attempting to pop an element from an empty stack.
  - Overflow: In fixed-size implementations (such as an array-based stack), an error is raised when trying to push an element onto a full stack.
