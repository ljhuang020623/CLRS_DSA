# CLRS_DSA: Python Implementations & Study Notes

This repository is my personal study project for the book *Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition)*, commonly known as CLRS. It contains my own Python implementations of algorithms and data structures along with detailed study notes, developed as part of the **Applied Algorithms** class, **CSCI-B405**.

## Overview

- **Course:** Applied Algorithms (CSCI-B405)
- **Reference Book:** *Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition)* by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein (CLRS)
- **Content Includes:**
  - Python implementations of key algorithms and data structures.
  - Detailed study notes, explanations, and examples based on the book.
  - Unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementations.
